/**
 * Holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework.
 * Note that these are entirely distinct. This class merely holds
 * both to make it possible for a controller to return both model
 * and view in a single return value.
 *
 * <p>Represents a model and view returned by a handler, to be resolved
 * by a DispatcherServlet. The view can take the form of a String
 * view name which will need to be resolved by a ViewResolver object;
 * alternatively a View object can be specified directly. The model
 * is a Map, allowing the use of multiple objects keyed by name.
